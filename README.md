# Short Application of the GARCH Model to Foreign Exchange Data â€“ USD and EUR

## Overview
This repository contains a coding exercise that applies the GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model to analyze the spot exchange rate between the US Dollar (USD) and Euro (EUR) from 1999 to 2024. The exercise involves downloading monthly data from the FRED database, performing exploratory data analysis, fitting various GARCH models, and conducting statistical tests.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, ensure you have R and R Studio installed on your machine. You will need to install the following R packages:
```R
install.packages(c("rugarch", "zoo", "strucchange", "tseries")) --> The rugarch package will serve pivotal when running the ARCH and GARCH models.
```

## Data Source
The monthly data used in this analysis is downloaded from the FRED database and represents the spot exchange rate between the US Dollar and Euro (Dollars per Euro). The data is available via the following URL:
```R
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kad407/Econometrics-II/73a10a49a5d7d5d07d84761c38bc26ef969003d0/EXUSEU.csv"
df = read.csv(url)  # Load the data into a dataframe named df

*You can also individually download the data from the FRED database (the dataset is available from the following link: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXUSEU) 

```

## Models Included
The following models are applied to the data:
- **GARCH(1,1) Model:** This model captures time-varying volatility using the `rugarch` package.
  - Code:
    ```R
    g1 = ugarchspec(variance.model=list(model="sGARCH", garchOrder = c(1,1)), 
                    mean.model=list(armaOrder=c(1,0), distribution.model="std"))
    garch_1_1 = ugarchfit(g1, data = e)
    ```
  
- **Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) Model:** An alternative GARCH model that captures leverage effects.
  - Code:
    ```R
    egarch = ugarchspec(variance.model=list(model="eGARCH", garchOrder = c(1,1)), 
                        mean.model=list(armaOrder=c(1,0), distribution.model="std"))
    egarch_1_1 = ugarchfit(egarch, data = e)
    ```

## Visualizations
The code generates several plots to visualize the data and model results:
- **Volatility of EUR/USD with GARCH(1,1):**
  ```R
  volatilitye = ts(garch_1_1@fit$sigma^2,end=c(2024,09),frequency = 12)
  plot(volatilitye, xlab="", ylab="", main = "Volatility of EUR/USD with GARCH(1,1)")
  ```
  
- **Volatility of EUR/USD with EGARCH(1,1):**
  ```R
  volatilitye2 = ts(egarch_1_1@fit$sigma^2,end=c(2019,10),frequency = 12)
  plot(volatilitye2, xlab="", ylab="", main="EUR/USD Volatility (EGARCH[1,1])")
  ```

- **Comparative Plot:**
  ```R
  ts.plot(volatilitye, volatilitye2, col=c("black","red"), xlab="")
  legend("topright", legend=c("Standard GARCH","Exponential GARCH"), col=c("black","red"), lty=c(1,1))
  ```

## Statistical Tests
- **Ljung-Box Test for Residuals:**
  This test checks for serial correlation in the residuals.
  ```R
  lag.length = 30
  Box.test(e, lag = lag.length, type = "Ljung-Box")  # Test for stationarity
  ```

- **Structural Break Analysis:**
  The analysis identifies structural breaks in the time series data using the `strucchange` package.
  ```R
  time = c(1:length(e))
  BP = breakpoints(e ~ time, h = 46)  # Identify structural breaks
  plot(BP)  # Visualize the structural break
  ```
